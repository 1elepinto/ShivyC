Biotechnology is not only useful for creating new products, but also for understanding how life works. One of the tools of biotechnology is genetic engineering, which involves modifying the DNA of an organism to introduce new traits or functions. Genetic engineering can be used to create transgenic organisms, such as bacteria that produce insulin or plants that resist herbicides.
 
Another tool of biotechnology is DNA sequencing, which involves determining the order of nucleotides in a DNA molecule. DNA sequencing can be used to identify genes, compare genomes, and trace evolutionary relationships. DNA sequencing has also enabled the Human Genome Project, which aimed to map the entire human genome and identify all the genes that make us who we are.
 
Biotechnology has led to many scientific achievements that have improved our lives and our knowledge of the world. For example, biotechnology has helped to develop vaccines and drugs for various diseases, such as hepatitis B, HIV, and cancer. Biotechnology has also helped to create new sources of energy, such as biofuels and biogas. Biotechnology has also helped to protect the environment, such as by using microorganisms to degrade pollutants or by creating biodegradable plastics.
