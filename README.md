# ShivyC

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ShivamSarodia/ShivyC.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ShivamSarodia/ShivyC)

ShivyC is a small C11 compiler written in Python 3, targeting Linux x86-64 machines. Seeks to eventually support the entire C11 standard and produce reasonably efficient code, although it's currently far from meeting these long-term goals.

It's a rewrite from scratch of my older attempt at a C compiler, [ShivC](https://github.com/ShivamSarodia/ShivC), with much more emphasis on feature completeness and code quality. See the ShivC README for more details on the target improvements.
