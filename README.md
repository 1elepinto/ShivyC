# ShivyC

ShivyC is a small C11 compiler written in Python 3, targeting Unix x86 machines. Seeks to eventually support the entire C11 standard and produce reasonably efficient code, although it's currently far from meeting these long-term goals.

Its a rewrite from scratch of my older attempt at a C compiler, [ShivC](https://github.com/ShivamSarodia/ShivC), with much more emphasis on feature completeness and code quality. See the ShivC README for more details on the target improvements.
